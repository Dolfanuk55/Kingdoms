                <p>The Miami Dolphins are a professional American Football team playing at Sun Life Stadium. The Dolphins are a part of the
                    AFC East division in the NFL. The team began its playing days in 1966 when Joe Robbie and Danny Thomas founded the
                    now great team. The region did not have an American Football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played
                    in the All American Football Conference in 1946. Miami made its first Super Bowl in 1971, but lost 24-3 to the
                    Dallas Cowboys. In 1972/73 Don Shula led the team to the only ever perfect season, winning every game and beating
                    the Washington Redskins 14 - 7.
                </p>
                <p>Many more years followed full of success and in the 1983 season vs the Raiders, Shula replaced quarterback
                    David Woodley with Rookie Dan Marino who went on the achieve the AFC passing title with a ratio of 20 TD versus
                    6 interception's. In his first full season in 1984 the Dolphins won there first 11 games going on to a 14-2 season, with a impressive set of passing stats.
                    The Miami Dolphins have set records and continue to this day to be a driving force in the NFL and a team known around
                    the globe.</p>
