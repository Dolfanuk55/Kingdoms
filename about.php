                <p>The Miami Dolphins are a professional American Football team playing at Sun Life Stadium. Miami are a part of the
                    AFC East division in the NFL. The team began its playing days in 1966 when Joe Robbie and Danny Thomas founded the
                    now great team. The region did not have an American Football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played
                    in the All American Football Conference in 1946. Miami made its first Super Bowl in 1971, but lost 24-3 to the
                    Dallas Cowboys. In 1972/73 Don Shula led the team to the only ever perfect season, winning every game and beating
                    the Washington Redskins 14 - 7.
                </p>
                <p>Many more years followed full of success and in the 1983 season vs the Raiders, Shula replaced quarterback
                    David Woodley with Rookie Dan Marino who went on the achieve the AFC passing title with a ratio of 20 TD versus
                    6 interception's. In his first full season in 1984 the Dolphins won there first 11 games going on to a 14-2 season, with a impressive set of passing stats.
                    The Miami Dolphins have set records and continue to this day to be a driving force in the NFL and a team known around
                    the globe.</p>
                <p>In the early 1990's a national TV station in the UK started to broadcast live games very early and the game grew, ask any
                    man who was around in that day about NFL on channel 4 they will undoubtedly mention Dan Marino or the Fridge. Many having fond memories of that time
                    and still many being fans today. The game over in the UK eased off towards the the late 1990s and moving into the 2000's. Still people followed and Sky started to broadcast the games,
                    and now we have the International Series and games on weekly, it really is a great time to be a fan.</p>
                <p>With the game growing in the UK we are trying to bring you an up to date and great community, to bring you news and thoughts from all
                    at Sun Life and beyond. The Kingdom as we are known is a place for you to read and comment on all things Dolphins via our social pages and blog and really
